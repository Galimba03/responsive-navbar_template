# Navbar template

This is a site that I created by myself to learn how to properly code with HTML and CSS. This site for now only contains a navigation bar with a submenu list and a subsubmenulist.

## Installation

To dowload the website there are two metods:

1. Click the "< > Code" icon and then "Download ZIP";
2. Use the following command inside the folder you want to download the site in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galimba03/responsive-navbar_template.git
```

## Contributing

For obvious reasons, the commits are not welcome. This will ruine the template and people won't be able to download the original one. You are more than welcome to download it and modify it as you please.

## License

Special thanks to Bedimcode for his [base sheet](https://github.com/bedimcode/responsive-dropdown-menu-2/tree/start-project) of the website structure.

## Contact

If you need any help for whatever reason or you have any question, feel free to dm me on discord: Galimba03

## Conclusion

‚≠ê If you liked this website template, a star would be appreciated! Thanks :)
